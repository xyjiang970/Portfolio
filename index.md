Hi, Iâ€™m XinYu (Jason) Jiang. I collect, manage, and convert raw data into usable information that informs business decisions and save costs. By transforming data into formats that can be easily analyzed - I work to effectively turn business questions into data analysis, helping teams provide meaningful recommendations on strategy.

Check out what I'm working on **[here](/projects/)**.
