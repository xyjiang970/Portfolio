# CIS 9760 Big Data Technologies: Project 1 - OpenSearch & Kibana

This project is an an introduction to using Amazon Web Services' [OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/the-elk-stack/what-is-opensearch/) and visualizations were made using [Kibana](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/the-elk-stack/kibana/).

The goal is to fetch and upload between 300K-500K rows of data from NYC Open Data's [Open Parking and Camera Violations dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Open-Parking-and-Camera-Violations/nc67-uf89) and explore the data using Kibana to help answer the following four questions:

<ol>
  <li>Which license type receives the most violaitons? (You can find what each license code corresponds to <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/registration/registration-class-codes" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
  <li>What is the most common violation?</li>
  <li>Which year had the most violations?</li>
  <li>How many of the violations from the data is actually not guilty?</li>
</ol>
