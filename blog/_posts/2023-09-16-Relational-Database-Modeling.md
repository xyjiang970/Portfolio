A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model.

A relational data model is a broad way to represent data and their relationships to other data. In a relational database, data is stored in a tabular format (rows and columns). Each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key, and connects to other tables via foreign keys. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

Relational models themselves donâ€™t necessarily give data teams the best way to scale their data models because of their focus on relationships and not business logic or use cases. Instead, it offers a foundation to build more robust relational modeling processes, such as dimensional modeling, to establish data models that scale in an organized and repeatable manner.

<h3 id="Relational Models are Good For">Relational Models are Good For:</h3>
- Low volume data and a small number of data sources.
- Simple use cases for the data.
- Low-medium concern around data warehousing costs (because relational models often need joining to be made meaningful).
